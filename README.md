## üß± Project Structure

### `/Interfaces`

- **`IQrCodeService.cs`**  
  Defines the **contract** for QR code-related operations, including generating and decoding QR codes. This interface abstracts QR code functionality, allowing for flexible swapping of the implementation or independent testing.

- **`IUrlShortenerService.cs`**  
  Declares methods for **URL shortening** services. This interface allows the app to shorten URLs before encoding them into QR codes, enabling more compact QR code content.

- **`IWatermarkService.cs`**  
  Specifies methods for **applying watermarks** to QR code images. This supports **customization** and **branding**, allowing QR codes to have logos, text, or other branding elements added to them.

---

### `/Models`

- **`QrCodeSettings.cs`**  
  Contains **configuration settings** for QR code generation, such as:
  - Size, colors, and error correction levels
  - Other customization options for the QR code

  This model centralizes all QR code-related settings, ensuring consistency across the app.

---

### `/Services`

- **`QrCodeService.cs`**  
  Implements the **`IQrCodeService`** interface using libraries like **QRCoder** and **ZXing.Net**. It handles the **core logic** of creating QR codes and decoding data from QR code images.

- **`UrlShortenerService.cs`**  
  Implements the **`IUrlShortenerService`** interface, providing **URL shortening** functionality. This service interacts with external APIs or custom logic to shorten URLs before encoding them into QR codes.

- **`WatermarkService.cs`**  
  Implements the **`IWatermarkService`** interface, adding **watermarks** or overlays to QR code images. This feature is useful for branding or additional visual customization of QR codes.

---

### `/Form`

- **`Form1.cs`**  
  The main **WinForms form** where users interact with the application. It contains UI elements like:
  - Text inputs, buttons for generating and decoding QR codes
  - Color pickers for customization
  - Picture boxes to display generated QR codes

  Event handlers in this file connect user actions (e.g., button clicks) to corresponding service calls.

- **`Form1.Designer.cs`**  
  An **auto-generated file** that defines the layout and UI controls of the form, such as:
  - Buttons, labels, text boxes, and image containers
  - Ensures the form‚Äôs controls are properly positioned and styled
